# Day 1 (5 June, Thursday)

Travel seemed to start very smoothly. I barely registered time spent at the airport. Flight was very short, just 3 hours, what felt like nothing in comparison with flying to India. I slept a little, read a little further into "The Knight in the Panther's Skin". I had luck to be at the window again and I liked especially one moment when we entered cover of clouds at the start of our landing.

The airport in Kutaisi was calm experience. Flush of memories from my first trip to Georgia dawn upon me. As if there were not enough reminders, we saw big stray dogs as soon as we left the airport. We waited for our rental car to arrive for a little bit.

I texted few women from my last trip to Georgia and so far only Leluka responded. It was nice to catch up, she also suggested me what vegan food I could find in Georgian cuisine.

After getting the car we headed to the Kutaisi proper. Just soon after leaving airport area we saw cows grazing along the road and often coming on the road as if it's nothing. Naturally it was shocking for the rest. Similarly, they commented about state of the buildings, cars and general vibe as being from different era. Reminiscing them of our own "communist" times of PRL (Polish People's Republic).

When we arrived close to the market, which was our goal, we couldn't find any spot to park the car so we were circling a lot. It allowed to observe more behavior on the street and they thought that the way cars drive and people cross the street is very chaotic. For me it didn't seem so after India. Georgia seems to be closer to our order than chaos on the streets of India. It's enough to mention that pedestrian traffic light is actually used.

Eventually we managed to park somewhere and we went to the direction of the market. Area around was very beautiful. Fountain in the middle of roundabout with animal statues was close to nice looking park. Just close from there was our goal, the market.

There was interesting wall at one side of the market. It was full of carvings of various scenes, characters, vines. It's meaning was escaping me, but it truly looked amazing. Before entering inside we bought some of Georgian breads as we were already quite hungry. I choose for myself lobiani, as Leluka reminded me about its existence. It's kind of bread stuffed with beans and it's quite filling.

We entered inside to the market. It attacked us with plethora of sensory experiences. Both pleasant and not so pleasant. Smell and color of spices (significantly different than the ones in India), but also inescapable meat or smoked cheese, which is not the best experience for vegans. As a market it wasn't all about food, but there were surprisingly little trinkets, mostly food and clothes. The most notable, besides general vibe, was one stall where Damian and mom negotiated in Polish with old guy who knew some Russian. They bought some alcohols and I chosen some sweets for myself. Interesting for me were thin sweets which look like pancakes, but are made fully out of juice. I also liked row of stalls with pickles. Mom bought something, but because we looked interested, old lady at the stall gave me and Damian something for free too to try.

After experiences in the city we returned to car and went to our apartment. It was in town outside of Kutaisi. Apartment was really beautiful. We had one wide common room for ourselves and three bedrooms. As we were getting ourselves ready for the rest of the day, we had guests. They were three little kittens with their mother. At first they were quite careful, but soon were playing inside apartment and sleeping at our chairs.

We decided to go outside. Just on the opposite to gates of our place was staircase leading down so we wanted to see where it leads to. We went down and we found old train station. It was abandoned, but in its prime state it had to be very beautiful. Then we went for a walk around. We saw a lot of stray dogs, often quite big ones. Eventually, one big dog followed us closely, often just at our feet. We didn't give him any attention, but he was still following us. First some cow was giving him chase. Then it was other dogs. As far as we went he was following us and local dogs were attacking him, probably as the one who doesn't belong to their area. My mom was scared when dogs were running towards us (but to "our" dog actually), but Gosia even more. It become quite scary for them, because it seemed to never end. There were a lot of dogs everywhere and he was always following us. We saw also pigs roaming close to the streets. It was sight quite unbelievable to see in a town, so close to Kutaisi.

The dog rested just at our gates. We freshened ourselves before going back to Kutaisi to restaurant to eat something at the evening. When we left, the dog still was waiting for us. We went to Magnolia restaurant which looked truly amazing. It looked like carved in a cave, there were a lot of small details and carvings. I chose plate of various types of pkhali, which is type of dish made out of minced and ground vegetables. Alongside that I picked variety of pickles. After leaving the restaurant we done few photos with the waterfall and the city at night in the background.

When we returned to the apartment, it came out that the dog is still waiting for us at the gate. Why is he clinging to us so desperately, while other dogs not. We were tired after whole day and not sleeping much at previous night either so we went to sleep soon afterwards.

# Day 2 (6 June, Friday)

We packed and left the apartment. The dog was still sitting and waiting for us at the gate. It was so sad, but we had to leave him and drive away. I had messages from other girls from my previous trip, Tínatín and Sophie.

Our first goal was Prometheus Cave. We stopped along the way at random place to do photos of the landscape. After that, I spotted by chance old hanging bridge and we went to explore it carefully. We went as far as the middle point, but no farther, because we saw that there are loose wooden planks and hole on the other side of the bridge. But it was enough, we made nice photos on it.

Prometheus Cave was full of wide corridors and enormous spacious halls. Fantastically shaped stalactites, stalagmites and columns created impression of an alien world. It was discovered only recently by late Soviet exploratory expedition in '80 and only recently opened for tourists. In one of the halls, there were natural structure that looked like couple looking at each other. We learned that because of that this hall is used as place for a weddings. After regular tour there was an option to go for a boat and we choose it. There was a big queue leading to underground river, with people from previous group too. A boat was taking 15 people at once and we had to wait for 2 turns before we could board the boat. Interplay between water surface, cave structures, color lights that lit the tunnel and modest speed of the boat create beautiful experience. It finished with the blinding light at the end of the tunnel and we exited to lush, natural greenery which gave striking contrast to bare and lifeless caves. We got into a bus that drove us to entrance area with parking.

Before leaving, I went to the toilets with mom and Gosia while Damian left already to the car. Along the way back, women wanted to buy coffee, but people at the shop had some problems with express and it was taking a lot of time. Damian was getting impatient and was calling us from the distance. When we finally got the coffee we could return to the car.

The next stop was Okatse Canyon. The road there was a little longer and we got into a path that was clearly not main road. We even had bunch of horses blocking our path. Horses were added to menagerie of animals we already saw then. But they were clearly confused with our presence which made us think that they are not used to too much traffic. When we arrived at the parking before tourist center we were swarmed by men who tried to explain something to us. I couldn't clearly understand their English and context made me confused. At first I thought they are from the parking collecting fee, then I thought maybe they are tourist information (it's not so out of blue, in previous place there was person like that who approached us on his own). But they were local people who were offering drive to the canyon and back. We decided not to take it and we went for a walk to the canyon. There was narrow paved way leading to the canyon through the forest area. It taken approximately an hour to reach there. When we reached there, mom couldn't find one of our two tickets and I already thought I won't enter. But she found it so we all could enter.

We traversed along platforms hanging in the air. Looking down through the grid was overwhelming. Views were truly extraordinary, scale and enormity of it all was hard to comprehend. We said that no photos could really try to capture it, but it didn't stop us from trying. Similarly, words escape me from explaining it. At the exit we were climbing stairs and it was quite tiring for mom. We noticed cows grazing at the slopes. It was surreal to see, at such slopes and so close to deep canyon.

At the exit from stairs some local caught us and offered us drive to the parking. We were hesitant, but we started negotiating. He lead us just a little higher and we saw his car in which engine he was tinkering. But it wasn't our ride. His son came soon in another. It was crude, sturdy old car and son looked like he's too young for driving licence. The road was bumpy, full of mud and quite extreme, but our driver was completely unphased. We all started to laugh at the situation from the mix of being scared, surprised and excited for new experience.

Upon arriving at the parking we were relieved to get to our car and drive at our pace. We commenced journey. We were supposed to find new apartment along the planned route. There were some problems with network and we didn't turn at correct turn. We had to stop to calmly find something out, because out of hunger there was slight tension. We decided that because wrong turn it makes sense to return to Kutaisi and found new apartment there. We found something with swimming pool so we were excited to use it at the end of the day. Before coming we stopped at small town restaurant and made quite a big feast. From my side I chose lobiani and mushrooms in clay pot. Besides that I tried little from others' orders which were vegan as well. Salads with walnuts, fries and tomato sauce.

Our next apartment was placed at the outskirts of Kutaisi on the steep slope. It made striking effect, because we were going down from entrance, but we still had balcony in our room. Place was decorated like from previous polish era. We tried to talk with old man from apartment to establish prices. He was using Google Translate to translate directly from Georgian to Polish, he hasn't been able to speak even a little Russian like most older Georgians and people from tourist industry. After quick shower we went to swimming pool. It was very nice, but little too cold at this time for me. Either way it was great finish for the day and afterwards we quickly went to sleep.

# Day 3 (7 June, Saturday)

When we woke up we packed quite quickly and started further journey. We convinced Damian that since we're still in Kutaisi we should visit some church before leaving. We wanted to see Bagrati Cathedral. It was on UNESCO Heritage Site List, but was eventually taken out of it due to controversial restoration works. The Cathedral looked like mosaic. Big parts were made from stone architecture that seemed (although even that part was mostly restored since 1950'), but there were elements which completely stick out and look very modern and out of place. No wonder it was stripped out of UNESCO List. While we were walking around outside I commented that Gosia and even my mom are not dressed properly for entering Orthodox Church. I wasn't mistaken. When we approached entrance, two old women said them that they should wear scarf on their head and they can find them just on the right after entering. When we were already inside it looked weird with Gosia wearing scarf, but having shorts and slightly visible belly. We have been getting suspicious looks and one woman approached them with two long scarf to tie it around their waist. There were not a lot of people there, but something was going on. Women's choir was singing, priests were doing something in the middle, someone was lighting candles at the sides. We all felt unique atmosphere, not being familiar with Orthodox rites and customs.

After the church most of the day was spent on the road. It's not possible to describe every point, because traveling through serpentine Caucasian roads provided us with inexhaustible supply of picturesque views. As we said multiple times, we could stop anywhere and it would look beautiful. Steep slopes covered by lush greenery, breathtaking canyons and occasional lakes and rivers beautifully mirroring clear sky. And the cherry on the top of all the amazing views were towering snowy mountains in the distance.

Among all the things we passed I noted in my head few places. First Nakerala Pass with its viewpoint where everyone was stopping. Obviously big noticeable part was the name itself, inevitable reminding Kerala. My mom was asking about unusual crosses we saw so far and one more was there as well. I found out it's so called Saint Nino's Cross, patron saint of Georgia who proselytized it in 4th century. Just after viewpoint we stopped at the lake and tipped our toes in the water. Long stretching lake was like beautiful composition at the foot of green mountains with taller snowy mountains in farther background. I noticed one unfinished bridge and we stopped at one side of it. On the other side, on ramp was herd of cows grazing apparently on bare rock and asphalt. Soon after that we bought fresh strawberries from old lady. It was wonder how far from any town she was sitting with the hopes of selling her harvest.

We stopped at Oni for some break and coffee. It was small sleepy town that seemed almost empty and eerily calm. We wanted to see synagogue, but it was closed so we could see it only briefly from the outside. When we went to grocery shop for some food, I was afraid that I won't find anything for myself, but I found some nice chocolate waffles that are vegan and tkemali - which is Georgian sauce made out of plums as main ingredient and various spices and herbs.

We arrived to Borjomi around 7 PM, which was end goal for today. It is beautiful resort town and we wanted to see it along our long road to Wardzia. We were driving narrow road up, until we reached end of the road and someone stopped us. They were our hosts and basically at the end of the road was our small two room cottage with veranda facing view on the town. We refreshed ourselves and went down to town center when it was already dark. It was nice little town, so reminiscent of other familiar resort towns. Buildings looked cozy and taken care of. Nicely dressed young people were walking in cohorts in look for entertainment. Their clothes, their looks, mannerisms and behavior reminded me of girls I met years ago in my first trip to Georgia. We finished the day in quite fancy restaurant. Others weren't fully satisfied, because previous days we ate a lot more with similar price and according to them it wasn't as tasteful either. From my side I was satisfied with my lobio (beans) and Bulgarian pepper stuffed with walnut paste. After climbing back to our cottage we went to sleep soon.

# Day 4 (8 June, Sunday)

We packed and went down to the town. Yesterday evening we saw it only a little bit and now in the light of the day the town looked even more charming. We went to central park and there to gondola lift. Ride on the lift was really nice. Rapid ascent gave amazing effect and view. There were not much to do at the top so we just briefly wandered around, bought lemonade and waited for return of the lift. While waiting we saw that cable from the lift just going through the hole in the window. It didn't particularly reassured us.

At our way to Wardzia we stopped at hanging narrow bridge. Jeep just slowly crawled through it which looked bizarre and dangerous, but managed to cross it. Then we went through it themselves on foot. It was possible to swing it to the sides quite easily and Damian indeed did it. We did another stop when we saw some interesting ruins with Georgian flag waving at the top. But we didn't stop directly close to it, but at small Orthodox church nearby. Mom and Gosia again weren't dressed properly, but there were scarves at the entrance they could use. Gosia still didn't cover herself properly and although she had scarf on the head her cleavage was sticking out. The church's inside was small and filled with incense aroma and light beams from ceiling pierced through the smoke. It created contemplative atmosphere alongside icons gazing at us all around walls.

Unfortunately, when we commenced travel, Gosia realized that we're going in wrong direction. Something that supposed to be only 1.5 h long journey extended considerably. Now we had to drive another 2.5 h and pass through Borjomi again. At Borjomi we did small stop to do the shopping. But as if we didn't loose enough time already, it came out that we parked in place we shouldn't. Policeman gave us mandate, but he didn't want to take money in cash directly. He instructed us to go to any bank with mandate note and pay there. As we were leaving Borjomi we saw pig transported loosely on trailer, another sign of Georgian attitude. Then we passed by two towers and Atskuri Fortress on the hill. It seemed like views changed constantly. More rocky mountains pierced landscape. And then also short grassed curvy pastures. Shimmering river accompanying us along the road. Change from Caucasian environment was noticeable. At this point we established running gag of the trip. Damian, despite of being our driver, he constantly was fawning over any new beautiful view while my mom was scared that he is too distracted by it. "Wow, look at that, we didn't see something like that so far!" phrase was dropped at least every ten minutes.

When we were almost at our goal, we stopped at Khertvisi Fortress. We climbed to the entrance passing by regular house at the side opposite to the fortress wall. People were living there, laundry was hanging, kids were playing, old ladies selling homemade food and trinkets, but house looked like natural extension of the fortress. Built from the same stone material, sitting just there naturally fitting in to landscape. After entrance I saw ornamented stone fragments on display at the sides of the road. Sun was beating hard today so we could seek relief in the shadows of the wall or inside towers, thanks to heat trapping thick stones. To some degree it reminded me castles from polish Jura Krakowsko-Częstochowska. At the top of one of the towers was Orthodox shrine and outside Georgian flags with which we did photo session on the background of tall mountains.

When we arrived at our new stay, we were truly amazed how in the middle of nowhere it all seemed. Teenager girl opened gate for us and run to show us where we could park. Small spaniel-like dog accompanied her. We had two small wooden houses for ourselves, kitchen in separate building and big backyard. All around us only beautiful halls and mountains. She was little nervously explaining that one house is ready, but second will be in just five minutes. She was unsure of her English, but it was decent and we were able to learn everything and settle formalities. We wanted just to unpack and quickly go to Wardzia, because it was getting to be closed soon. Just before we were leaving I had quick chat with teenage girl and her mother. Mother asked me if I play some music and I learned that their whole family is musical. I excused myself and said that we're in a hurry to see Wardzia complex before it will be closed.

Wardzia is complex of middle ages cave monastery cut in the stone mountain, associated with famous queen Tamar and poet (from "The Knight in the Panther's skin"). Strong earthquake split the site in effect creating image reminiscent of beehive when seen from the distance. I had exactly that impression when we were driving towards it. When we parked and mom saw it up close she decided that she won't be able to climb all the way there and she will stay at the bottom. It was sad, but she was probably right. Maybe she could climb to first chambers, but further parts are going up and down through tough stairs. Three of us entered past the ticket entry alongside schoolchildren trip. Kids were inexhaustible in their energy and they were running up quite a distance from their guardian ladies left behind. First chambers and rooms were interesting enough and from them we saw beautiful panorama. Somehow we felt that this is it, but it was because bigger part was obscured from that angle. When we crossed some point the complex revealed itself in all its splendor. The highlight for me was Dormition Church, heart of monastery and corridors leading from it. Pleasantly cold, incense smell in the air and faded icons. We exited from the other side through corridor with steep stairs. After that started labyrinth of stairs, chambers and corridors. I felt like in exploratory video game where I wanted to complete every path. Schoolchildren trip wasn't so thorough as us and soon enough we could see them only from the distance on different elevations. At the end we were going down rapidly through staircase tunnels from almost the top to the ground level.

When returning to our houses we made some small grocery shopping in village shop. I was worried about food for myself, but it was in the end doable with mix of bread, vegetables and plum sauce. Except familiar small dog, at the gate to our stay we were welcomed this time by man, his wife and daughter already left. He didn't speak English at all, but was trying to communicate mostly to my mom by Russian. He shared more information and also food, like Georgian bread. He left after a while. We prepared food and decided to eat outside, being in the middle of such amazing landscape. After eating somewhat, we thought that it's almost time for sunset. To see it, we left the field of our stay and tried to climb near hill quickly. We didn't manage on time and saw only pink sky on the mountainous horizon. While we were atop that hill, we noticed that we are surrounded by familiar herbs like coriander. Damian called some dog, from the distance he looked like our little dog from stay, because he was black as well. But it was other dog, very big one with massive snout. He was very calm, but we felt unease around him, unlike any other dog here in Georgia so far. We were trying slowly to backtrack to our territory behind the fences. He calmly followed us, we didn't allowed him to enter with us through the fence door, but he simply went under the fence, despite his size. Our small dog vanished suddenly. We quickly moved the rest of the food from outdoor table and moved to a house. After a moment I checked outside and only small dog was left on our territory. Soon after that we went to sleep and I turned on some Russian movie for my mom on TV.

# Day 5 (9 June, Monday)

We knew that there is a long road ahead of us to Batumi and we wanted to start the day on a relaxing note beforehand. We learned from house owner that one sulfur bathhouse is just in neighborhood. In fact, it was the closest neighbor which could be seen when walking around hill on which our territory stand. House owner called the bathhouse announcing that we will come soon. The guy from bathhouse welcomed us in Russian and was explaining us price and other stuff. The bathhouse was placed literally under metal barracks. He showed us inside, shown sulfur rock. There was bigger pool with steaming green water and small one with cold water. Rooftop was on one half covered by metal sheet and on another only partially by tent material and rest open with only rusting frame. That small open side actually was for the better, because it left us with beautiful view on the mountains while we were bathing. Sulfur was leaving green patina on the sides of the pool, something that under other circumstances would be worrying. It was really pleasurable to get into this warm pool. I was swimming leisurely back and forth, only sometimes stopping in place. The guy screamed something from the outside to us, but we couldn't properly understand him. We understood only something about 15 minutes. We noticed smoke through opening in the rooftop. We thought that maybe he meant that we could sit in warm pool only 15 minutes at a time, but then we discovered that there is sauna behind locker room. He was heating up sauna and then we realized he was talking about 15 minutes maximum in the sauna at one sitting. We circled between warm pool, cold shower and pool and sauna few times. It was difficult to force myself to enter cold water, but somehow I managed it. We were fully satisfied with that experience and we were ready for long journey ahead.

We started road with quite familiar landscape, despite of running joke that Damian was pointing and claiming that we didn't see something like that so far every five minutes. Something notable along the way was Akhaltsikhe fortress that we just passed. Soon we saw snowy mountains in the distance and it looked like we will be passing through them, because we were crossing between the regions. We get excited and we indeed started to climb through serpentine roads higher and higher. When we were close to the snow, this time landscape truly looked different. Not only in nature, but habitats looked like they have been frozen in time. Simple wooden houses seemed in some stage of decay, but still visible inhabited, laundry and other signs of life on display. We stopped at some patch of snow. It was still surprisingly warm and I was able to be only in T-shirt at the top without discomfort. I touched the snow. It was covering stream underneath. It was dirty, very thick and hard pressed, hard in touch. Probably that made it so resilient to plus sign temperatures. It melts slowly and survives until next winter comes and gather new batch of fresh snow to fuse with.

It must have been the highest altitude during our journey, because after crossing that time-forgotten village with patches of snow we started to go more or less downhill for the rest of the travel. We didn't see more snow anymore either. Empty road ahead was under construction for a long stretch, almost to complete bottom. It forced us to drive with snail pace, even in comparison to already slow movement along curly mountainous roads. We understood why navigation was showing so long time estimation for arrival to Batumi. At some point we realized that we managed to drive only for few kilometers since last two hours. I wasn't particularly bothered, because views were amazing and with such low speed we could soak them peacefully.

When we were in the valley and road works stopped, signs of different region started to crop up. Palm trees and general impression in the air was of an approaching sea, but we were driving at the bottom of imposing mountain walls, which reminded me of all this artificial map boundaries in video games. We also noticed distinctive flag of the Adjara, which is the region of which Batumi is capital. This flag consists of regular Georgian flag in the top left border and blue and white stripes at the rest of it.

We entered Batumi through traffic jam and poor city outskirts. Damian was telling that he read about wealth contrasts in Batumi's architecture. Everyone was in haste to calling it slums, but I insisted that whatever we saw out there was definitely poor, but probably doesn't deserve moniker of slums. When we crawled into city center it became apparent why this city is sometimes called "Las Vegas of Black Sea". City skyline consisted of distinctive skyscrapers, luxury hotels, but also Soviet era apartment buildings. We circled a little bit around our hotel, before we managed to find any parking spot. Our hotel, Orbi Hotel, was huge multistory building with distinctive white-blue palette. The entrance was churning people in and out constantly. We met the guy from whom we booked room there. He led us to elevators. Despite multiple elevators, there were so much people and traffic that we waited a bit until we managed to get into our room at 20th floor. We asked him where is the pool that was advertised in booking app, but he laughed as if not understanding and said that we have sea nearby. He gave us the keys and left. We weren't happy and Gosia swore to smear him in the app.

While we were unpacking, Damian and Gosia decided to go out looking for restaurant at the roof that was advertised in the elevator. They vanished for quite a while and my mom started to feel impatient. We couldn't leave hotel before their return, because we had only one key. Our view from balcony had old residential buildings in front of us, while at the right was view of the shining sea just short walk from the hotel. When Damian and Gosia returned, there was a little tension between them and mom. They explained that they couldn't found the restaurant at the roof and that waiting times for the elevator here are terribly long. Tension fizzled out a little after a moment, but didn't disappear completely, as far as I felt it. They decided that they had to rest a little bit before going out, especially because Damian was driver for whole day. Me and mom were restless and we wanted to see the city and the sea. We decided that we will call each other after they rest and decide if they want to go out and meet.

When me and mom went out, sunset time was approaching and we wanted to arrive at time. The promenade was spacious, going along wide rocky beach. My attention went to rows of palm trees along the bike lane. It was surprising sight for my mind, already used to seeing Caucasian mountainous ecosystems. Demographics changed as well, while in the mountains I was seeing mostly Russian, Polish and Indian tourists, here we had more Turkish and Arab families lazily strolling walkway. We went to sit at the beach to wait for sunset. I was surprised with this beach, because I was familiar only with sand beaches and beaches with huge rocks. Here beach was fully covered with smaller stones, in size of at least clenched fist. I thought that it was exactly size that would be the most uncomfortable to walk on. If it would be more like small pebbles cover, it would adjust under foot pressure. If it would be larger rocks, it would be easier to just leap from one to the other. At least, they were very smooth in texture and shape, thanks to tireless work of sea waves through the ages. I noticed group of young South Indians waiting for the sunset as well and idly building fragile towers out of smooth oblate stones. I indulged in building my own tower and it wasn't trivial to build stable construction out of oblate stones. The sunset was nice, sun vanished behind narrow strip of purple clouds just a little above the horizon.

After sunset we went back and forth at the promenade. As night city lights started to glow, I was eager to believe what I heard, that Batumi never goes to sleep. There was something in the atmosphere at the beach and city night skyline with its mosaic architecture that I was eager to believe in moniker of "Las Vegas of Black Sea". We were hungry so we started to look around for place to eat. Weirdly it wasn't easy to find restaurant with Georgian cuisine. Among common Turkish restaurants flaunting their halal marks of approval, I spotted even restaurant serving Ukrainian food. Painted Slavic woman with blonde braids and in folk clothes serving borsch was smiling at us from the wall. Finally we decided on one which apparently served varied cuisine. My instincts were telling me that it's too expensive restaurant, but I wasn't traveling alone and either way costs are not so big in Georgia.

Inside there was dance and music show, but we were quickly led by waitress away from central room to side room with view at the sea. Still I had some limited view on the show through the door. Before we realized, waitress brought us tablets with menu and she set little polish flag at our table. We didn't even remember saying or being asked about nationality, but probably we just filtered some questions as unremarkable courteousness. Music was changing and soon there was belly dancer at the center. To our surprise, she went through dynamic dancing through our side rooms as well. I wasn't sure what to make of it, but to some degree it reminded me "Mayya Mayya" song from movie "Guru". Soon Damian and Gosia joined us at the restaurant. I saw that show changed to Georgian ballet and I was disappointed that I was able to see those crazy moves only to limited degree through open door. Mom told them about belly dancer who went through our room. We were there long enough though that shows started to cycle back so belly dancer again appeared. Gosia looked disapprovingly at Damian's reaction and started to speculate with my mom that there should be equality and some scantily clad male dancer should also come. After we were satiated we returned to hotel to sleep.

# Day 6 (10 June, Tuesday)

Wandering around for morning grocery
Old Town
Orthodox church with słoma
Piazza
Port
Ali and Nino moving statues
Spinning wheel
Indian restaurant - Riba Sebastian, malayali girl
Return to hotel, sleep
Alone for swimming
Return to old town, felt awkward at Indian restaurant
Evening prayer from mosque

In the morning mom wanted to prepare some breakfast so we decided to go for grocery shopping. It took surprisingly long. Whenever I found some bigger grocery store on the map or just in the distance, it came out it was still closed at this time in the morning or was in general renovation. We ended up in just regular small shop where mom could communicate to limited degree in Russian with old lady working there. We did quite a distance around in the end so my mom was tired when we finally returned to the hotel. When everyone finally got prepared and we ate something, we went out for the beach. We went in opposite direction and settled in some spot for a while close to the water. I tried to enter the water and to my chagrin, I discovered that small stone cover was going far to the sea so it was uncomfortable to walk to the water. I didn't understand how some people around seemed to be not bothered at all, children running around as if it is just regular sandy beach. I was comforted that I wasn't alone in this and Damian was also limping while trying to get deeper to the water. After a short while, Gosia checked point of interests on the map and told us that from there it is not reasonable for us to go somewhere on foot and we should take taxi and go to Old Town and places around.

Taxi dropped us just close to some Orthodox church so we decided to enter. From experience I felt that again there will be some tension with how mom and Gosia are dressed or if we behave appropriately. Almost whole floor of the church was covered by hay for some reason. Taking photographs were forbidden, but they tried to sneakily take some. Just after leaving church, we went to so-called Piazza which was just few steps away. It was like public square taken directly out of Italy's town. It wasn't wrong impression, because as we read, it is officially called Piazza and was inspired by Italian architecture. Mosaic art in the center of the square was circled by shops, cafes and hotels. They wanted to drink coffee so it was place just perfect for that. After sipping through our coffees, we headed into direction of the sea. The street that lead us was cozy and picturesque, fitting for Mediterranean climate. Despite of just finishing one coffee, Damian and Gosia taken interest in one cafe that were doing coffee out of "sand" which is, as I learned later, Turkish style of preparing coffee. I was tempted with taking one as well, because they had vegan cappuccino. It was particularly artsy type of cafe with beautiful painted wall evoking sense of wetland ecosystem. At the back of it there was handcraft workshop where young woman was selling her own handcraft. Fittingly to the name of workshop - Lovecrafts - it was mostly mix of cute and grotesque, plush toys and small figurines.

When we arrived at the port, we were haggled by people on the boats offering various activities at the sea, like paragliding while being dragged by motorboat. Damian and Gosia were interested so they wanted to get to know price ranges. My instinct was to avoid such offers after traveling solo, but being in a group makes things more affordable. We decided on paragliding in pairs, but leaving it for the next day. Damian and Gosia would obviously go together so it would force mom to go with me. She was scared, but we had whole day to change her mind. At the port we found Ali and Nino dynamic metal sculpture. It's a relatively new artwork, created only in 2010, but it already become iconic landmark for Batumi, its likeness reproduced everywhere from billboards to tourist souvenirs like fridge magnets, t-shirts and mugs. It's inspired by old romance novel telling the tragic tale of two lovers. Ali, Azerbaijani Muslim man and Nino, Georgian Christian woman. Reminder that inter-communal love beyond barriers happen everywhere in the world and reach tragic end more than it should. It is artwork of two silhouettes made out of stacked metal plates that move in circle on trails to and from each other in a matter of around half an hour. When they approach each other, most resonant moment for me is when they seem to tenderly lean into each other, find brief respite on each other shoulders, just before they blend into themselves however briefly, to be separated in the end.

The port is very tourist oriented place and one of attractions that got Damian and Gosia attention was spinning wheel. Mom was hesitant to get onto it, but we convinced her. It was quite tall spinning wheel, but it's very slow moving which my mom commented about that while we were already on the top. Damian joked about mom that she was so panicking about it, but she don't find it scary anymore. He pointed that it is exactly same with paragliding and she should give it a shot. Mom said that she's adamant about that and paragliding is much scarier. We still have little more work on her to convince her. After strolling around the port for a little bit more, we were hungry. We went back to the direction of Old Town, looking for place to eat. We ended up in streets cramped by Turkish halal restaurants and we entered one such restaurant. I was tad worried that nothing on the menu look like potentially vegan so we decided to change the place. Among Turkish restaurants we found one Indian so we entered there.

Menu was more North Indian in style, but I was convinced that waitress is South Indian. They didn't have other clients at the moment so I didn't feel hesitant to talk to her a little bit. When I learned that she's from Kerala, my family exchanged knowing looks. I told her briefly about my visit to India, the wedding and which places I visited in Kerala. I learned that her name is Riba, she's from around Alappuzha and studies medicine in Georgia (like Sai Pallavi, I mentioned), working part time only as waitress. She was adorable and seemed to be genuinely nice. I wished to just talk with her more, but I didn't want to push it too much. Family teased me about her relentlessly, but they seemed to like her immediately too. They were happy and filled with food as well. We promised that we will come here again. Of course, they wanted to encourage me to get to know her better.

After eating, we returned to the hotel via taxi. We all went for a nap, but after short one for me, I didn't want to waste my limited time at the vacation in the hotel. I informed mom that I'm going for a swim. I didn't have SIM card with network here, we shared WiFi here from two phones that had it, so I had to return before they wake up and decide to leave, because at this point we wouldn't have way to communicate. Despite of that, I taken my time and get to swim long enough that I was satisfied. Waves were very minuscule so it was easy relaxing time. I swam along the coast back and forth and then looked for my clothes. When I returned to the hotel they were still chilling. At least I didn't have to feel guilty that they waited for me. It started to get late and I watched sunset from the balcony. Soon afterwards we left to the city again.

In many ways we were retracing our morning path, but the city felt different at night. Old Town bustled with life, especially the streets with Turkish restaurants. The family taken their time to sit and drink tea while call to prayer from the mosque engulfed area. We went to the Indian restaurant for late evening snacks, they had ulterior motive of giving me opportunity and push to talk to Riba again. Of course I had few exchanges with her when we were ordering, but Gosia tried to encourage me to take her contact. She asked if she should take contact from Riba, if that would be more appropriate. Gosia said that I should go and pay, which would give me another opportunity for talk. I sheepishly went, paid for us, smiled, but didn't have courage to say anything. I always had some doubts about attempting to get too familiar with waitresses, because it's their job to be nice. Additionally, what could follow up with getting contact? I didn't plan to return to Georgia any time soon. When we left restaurant, I immediately felt regret. I noticed certain disappointment on Gosia and Damian too. Afterwards we strolled around Old Town for a bit. My mood diminished significantly, but I tried to keep straight face and not spoil evening to others. I felt it's silly, but perhaps I had some glimmer of hope that such contact could fill gaping hole in my heart. After some more time of wondering around we returned to the hotel.

# Day 7 (11 June, Wednesday)

Swimming in the sea in the morning
Paragliding (dolphins, scared mom)
Wandering around for food, Georgian cuisine again, no seeing malayali girl
Swimming again and long sleeping at the beach
Strolling around looking for souvenirs and then books
Return to hotel
I left for promenade, spices, melancholia
Leaving to the city with Damian and Gosia later

I started my day with going for a swim alone again. I didn't want to loose time I had here, so when Damian and Gosia was still sleeping and my mom slowly waking up, I informed her that I will return soon. Water was pleasant, not very warm, but not cool either. There were already quite a lot of people at the beach at this time, but it wasn't crowded yet.

Our first agenda for the day was paragliding. We went to the port and started to look for best offers. At this point my mom was still insisting that she won't go flying, but she entered the boat, imagining that she will get on a ride while only we go up. But deal was already for two pairs. Gosia and Damian went first. It looked almost like being pulled up by elevator. Slow, steady movement, nothing to be afraid of, as I negotiated with mom. In the meantime, boat crew dressed up us in gear so I knew that mom couldn't back away now. She was telling me to say that she won't go, but I just was replying not to worry. When Damian and Gosia returned down, they were excited. Mom was saying to us again to tell boat crew that she won't go, upon which Damian replied smirking, "Tell them yourself". Mom didn't know what to do, she was probably too embarrassed to attempt any communication with boat crew, who wouldn't probably understand her either as they were too young to know Russian perhaps (although working with tourists, maybe it wasn't true). Me and mom were connected to paraglider. It felt like wind was blowing strongly into parachute (but it was boat moving, relative movement), but there were no sudden haul, just gently elevation. We climbed very quickly to the top and were dragged by the boat for a while. Mom said with surprise that it's actually not scary at all. I could only say that it was what we were trying to say to her all along. From above, I felt that I properly saw Batumi's landscape for the first time. Eclectic architecture of city skyline. Mountains circling around the coast and towering above the water. I never saw mountains and sea landscape blending so seamlessly into each other. My Polish brain was screaming that those two ecosystems don't belong together, but for that it was only more striking and beautiful for me. Probably the biggest highlight though was when we spotted dolphins effortlessly swimming in swarm just under the surface and jumping out of water without loosing momentum.

We got hungry after it so we started to look for food. We went to familiar streets, we even passed by Indian restaurant, but she wasn't working there in the morning. I tried to brush aside glimmers of hope and just move on. We went further than previously into other streets and we found actually Georgian restaurant. I ordered for myself variety of colorful pkhali and lobio (beans) which came in clay pot, it was generous with coriander as I already got used to it. After eating we returned to the port and from there to the beach. We weren't on the beach of this side of Batumi before. It was same rock beach as elsewhere and just there we found few sunbeds. Family wanted to lay on them. Nobody was using them, in fact people around were just sitting and laying on the rocks. No restaurant or any other establishment wasn't in proximity so they didn't seem to belong anywhere. Yet, I wondered if it's some Goldilocks situation and Three Bears will come soon to reclaim their belonging. Damian tried to stop me worrying and insisted it looks like publicly available. They lay down on them and I did too. I decided I will be going to swim for the most of the time either way. As I predicted some muscle man came claiming it's private. Damian unbothered and half-sleepily started to negotiate and the guy allowed to stay on it for two hours. I have no doubt that the sunbeds were set up here exactly for such situations, tempting tourists to use them instead of rocks of the beach. Situation being clear now, I relaxed for a bit, but after a while I was just too tired of resting and went to swim. Sea bed was very steep here just few steps to the water, so I had to quickly overcome initial chill of water and submerge quickly. There were Indian family around and I tried to discern what language they use, but I couldn't. My family went to swim for a little bit too, but they returned to sunbeds quickly and went to sleep. I didn't want to follow in their footsteps so besides more swimming I went for a longer walk along the coast. At some point I decided it is enough time here and we loose too much of our last full day in Georgia so I waken them up.

Next on our agenda was to look for souvenirs. Among other things, the family looked for alcohol and things I wasn't particularly interested in, but for once I was pretty clear what I wanted in souvenirs department. My friend Emilia wanted ugliest fridge magnet I could find and I just had one in mind - praise for Stalin. I bought one and thought about buying also pair of socks with Stalin (she's also fan of colorful socks), but disapproving words from my mom, saying that one such thing is enough, discouraged me. Besides I bought some fridge magnets about Batumi and Georgia generally for myself. I wanted also some sweets and spices, but spices around this area were overpriced for tourists, so I decided I will wait with spices at least for more regular shops, but I bought some churchkhela. Obviously I wanted to buy some books too. We split and I went with mom (I didn't have network on my phone so I couldn't go on my own). First bookstore was too small and didn't have much of translated books. Fortunately second one was just right and I found what I came for. I knew quite well what I want. I wanted Shota Rustaveli's "The Knight in the Panther's Skin", which is medieval national epic of Georgia. I had specific English edition in mind, with illustrations and translation by Lyn Coffin that preserve poetic structure of original. For good measure I wanted to add some contemporary novel and I found "The Literature Express" by Lasha Bugadze which is about romance between Georgian man and Polish woman. Perhaps I would prefer reversed situation, but strong Polish accent in Georgian novel was reason enough to take it without hesitation.

When we all were done with souvenirs and gifts, we went for walk around. It came out that so close to the port there were still so much we didn't see. We stumbled upon Statue of Medea, huge monument of Greek myth character associated with ancient Colchis, one of early ancient Georgian states. It was standing on Freedom Square circled by beautiful building. When we were looking around the Square and then walking even further away, I was really flabbergasted by how beautiful and creative architecture was here. Every building seems very different from others, but they somehow all manage to fit together. It really felt like just every building was interesting in some way. When it started to get dark and we were tired we decided to return to hotel.

I couldn't rest in hotel too much though. Others wanted to stay for longer in hotel, but I was too restless and I also wanted to buy some spices. I went then to look around shops and I found nice basket with collection of spices, which was just perfect as a souvenir. After that I went to walk along the coast. It filled me with melancholia which was like distant echo of that other night, at the other coast, far away in another part of the world, in Kochi, when I was saying my goodbyes to India. It wasn't as strong emotion as back then, but similarity of now reminisced me of then and feelings were amplified. I wanted to bask in this atmosphere of the coast at early night for longer and stretched it for a little bit, but eventually decided to return to the hotel. At the hotel, Gosia and Damian said that they wanted to go out to promenade too, although my mom was tired so she stayed in the hotel. We went around to buy some food and snacks and then went to promenade. We spent some time at the beach, but they taken some interest in entering club with guards outside. I felt that guards looked at us with suspicion and that we don't look particularly fitting to the place, but they fixed their minds and we eventually entered. We sat at some place and they went to dance. They returned soon and said that one guard said them that they need to buy something first. Just after some young guy came and said that we are sitting at his place. We felt so unwelcome that we just left. Gosia was a little drunk and upset about the situation, she pontificated about morality and what kind of people they think they are, feeling superior. We spent some time at the water, small tides brought calmness before we returned to the hotel.

# Day 8 (12 June, Thursday)

We woke up early, we had to return to Kutaisi for our flight. We left Batumi and went for few hour ride back. It felt like retracing our path, not only in geographical sense of landscapes and ecosystems, but also emotionally. Even common hit of the trip "Look at that! We didn't see anything like that before" from our driver must have appeared. Familiar sight of airport and stray dogs there greeted us. We had a little bit of time before our flight. There were not a lot of commotion at the airport and when we get to border control process it felt smooth and barely noticeable at this point.

At this point I have been flying few times, but I still felt amazement looking at the window during our start. I paid attention to the view outside for a little bit, but when visibility worsened I drifted into a sleep. We didn't particularly skipped nights during the trip, but small sleep deficits accumulated over the week and I felt too tired. When we landed back in Poland and we were already going to our car, network on my phone returned. Literally first news that greeted me while I was checking my phone was that prime minister Tusk has been planning to get rid off no visa movement to Poland for Georgians. It pained me, because we felt so welcomed in Georgia, but it was like if we were collectively unwelcome back. That how my second trip to Georgia ended up.

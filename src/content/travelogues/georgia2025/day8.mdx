We woke up early, we had to return to Kutaisi for our flight. We left Batumi and went for few hour ride back. It felt like retracing our path, not only in geographical sense of landscapes and ecosystems, but also emotionally. Even common hit of the trip "Look at that! We didn't see anything like that before" from our driver must have appeared. Familiar sight of airport and stray dogs there greeted us. We had a little bit of time before our flight. There were not a lot of commotion at the airport and when we get to border control process it felt smooth and barely noticeable at this point.

At this point I have been flying few times, but I still felt amazement looking at the window during our start. I paid attention to the view outside for a little bit, but when visibility worsened I drifted into a sleep. We didn't particularly skipped nights during the trip, but small sleep deficits accumulated over the week and I felt too tired. When we landed back in Poland and we were already going to our car, network on my phone returned. Literally first news that greeted me while I was checking my phone was that prime minister Tusk has been planning to get rid off no visa movement to Poland for Georgians. It pained me, because we felt so welcomed in Georgia, but it was like if we were collectively unwelcome back. That how my second trip to Georgia ended up.

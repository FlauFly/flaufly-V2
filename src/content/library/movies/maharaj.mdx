What not to love about Indian period drama with gorgeous scenery, clothes and sprinkle of Bollywood melodrama and songs? And additionally with important social commentary relevant still today? Well, maybe it's not everyone's cup of chai, but it's definitely mine. Despite of so many elements that should work for me, somehow it didn't quite land. I enjoyed watching it, but I felt that there was something missing. It was like pacing was too quick and nothing could be developed enough. After the movie I looked up at the duration of the movie and I was surprised it was over 2h. 

The theme of the movie is very important. Blind following of religion and godmen is problem in many places of the world, but especially in India. The story is based on real court case and as far as I know it was landmark case that shaken things and made precedent. Despite of this the movie somehow didn't manage to make the punch.

Jaideep Ahlawat in the role of JJ, titular Maharaj, religious leader did phenomenal job. It was easy to despise him, mark of great acting. Debut of Junaid Khan in lead role was quite decent, as far as nepo baby debuts considered.

My criticism shouldn't overcome the fact that I watched it with pleasure and don't regret time spent on it. In the time when big budget in India goes to propaganda movies aligned with current government narratives and a lot of critical movies are heavy censored or banned, such modestly critical movie can find its place.
